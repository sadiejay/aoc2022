// ! part 1 -
//  sounds like I need an object for selected shapes and an object for round outcome
// data needs odd inputs to be pushed to an array and even inputs pushed to an array
// need switch statements for each possiblity
// selected shapes isn't something that's "calulated" as opposed to round outcome
// once round outcome is calculated selected shape needs to be added

// selectedShapes = [
    // {shape: 'rock', shapePoints: 1, winsOver: 'scissors', losesOver: 'paper', oppCode: 'A', secCol: 'X'}
    // {shape: 'paper', shapePoints: 2, winsOver: 'rock', losesOver: 'scissors', oppCode: 'B', secCol: 'Y'}
    // {shape: 'scissors', shapePoints: 3, winsOver: 'paper', losesOver: 'rock', oppCode: 'C', secCol: 'Z'}
// ]

// roundOutcome = [
    // {winPoints: 6, drawPoints: 3, losePoints: 0,}
// ]
