# I DID IT

## Notes:
Having a few false starts. First I made and object with all the information, then thought to use the data to create more arrays. Lastly, I"m thinking to try and use the shapePoints to also determine roundOutcome.

- [Set JS object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) - I forgot that Set removes duplicates. Using it for the test worked because there were no duplicates, but caused big problems when I put in the actual data. I learned a big lesson. I at least know my code was good, but my data wasn't importing correctly. Without the tests I would have been completely in the dark.
