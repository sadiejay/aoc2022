# I DID IT AGAINNNN!!

## Notes:
Having a few false starts. First I made and object with all the information, then thought to use the data to create more arrays. Lastly, I'm thinking to try and use the shapePoints to also determine roundOutcome.

Part 2 bit me, but after thinking about it I took the letters and made pairs, then made switch statments (they're my fave lol)

Using it for the test worked because there were no duplicates, but caused big problems when I put in the actual data. I learned a big lesson. I at least know my code was good, but my data wasn't importing correctly. Without the tests I would have been completely in the dark.
