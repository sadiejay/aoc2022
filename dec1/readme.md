# I DID IT
First time completing an advent of code by myself for the most part. Can't wait to look back in some years to see how far I've come haha

## Notes:
I would love to know how to refactor the huge process data function I have going on lolol everything inside is like a nesting doll and I'm pretty sure that code could be a lot DRYer haha
